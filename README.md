# Recap I: Quiz App - Layout

In this project you will build the layout of your first mobile web application, a quiz app. In later
projects we will expand this app and add all sorts of cool functionality. In this app you will be
able to:

- Read questions and click buttons to look up the answers.
- Bookmark questions and view them on a bookmarks page.
- Visit your profile page.
